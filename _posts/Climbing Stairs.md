# Climbing Stairs
A famous dynamic programming question. Given a staircase of N steps, one can take one or two steps everytime. How many ways are there to climb N steps?

For example, given a staircase of 4 steps, the number of ways one can climb is shown as below.

From the graph, one can find graphs that look similar.

Based on the similarities, instead of finding all the ways to climb N stairs, one can use the previous calculations again in a bottom-up approach to find the solution.
