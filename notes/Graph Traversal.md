# Graph Traversal
Along with [Dijkstra's algorithm](obsidian://open?vault=notes&file=notes%2FDijkstra's%20Shortest%20Path), there are many algorithms for finding the shortest path between two points of the graph.
One of the common method is **A* Algorithm**. Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, it only finds the shortest path between the source and the destination. However, Dijkstra's algorithm has disadvantages that it is a greedy algorithm and doesn't really have a heuristic approach to finding the shortest path. A* algorithm with 0 weight on the vertices is Dijkstra's algorithm.
